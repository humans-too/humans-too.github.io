            We will cover <b>your living costs for three months</b> while you find
            and secure employment. This includes <b
              >rent, food, and all other essential expenses.</b

            The idea behind the fund is to facilitate the <em>transition</em> to
            independent life. In these three months, we will help you find a job,
            get settled, and build back stronger.

              Don't be intimidated. We're just trying to get a sense of who you are

          What we are looking for
        </h5>
        <article class="space-y-4">
          <p>
            The core question we ask is: <i
              >"Can this person make it on their own if given a real chance?"</i
            >. In your application, we look for signs of initiative, a drive for
            independence, and a genuine commitment to building a life that is
            <i>yours</i>.
          </p>

          <p>
            This also means that if your application is accepted, it tells
            something: we believe you can do this. A group of strangers analyzed
            your situation and chose to bet on you, because we're confident that
            you're capable of building the life you deserve.
          </p>
          <p>It is normal to be afraid, but don't let fear stifle you.</p>
