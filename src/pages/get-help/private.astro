          <p>
            All of us deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.
            Unfortunately, some of us have to fight for these rights. If you're
            one of those people, <b>we are in this fight with you</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We know it's like. To have relatives and friends dismiss your
            problems. To feel all alone, to wonder if you're the one
            over-reacting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Get in touch immediately if your parents are...
            <ul>
              <li>
                forcefully stopping you from education, or a career path you
                strongly want to pursue.
              </li>
              <li>
                pressuring you to marry someone, or break up with someone you
                love.
              </li>
              <li>
                denying food, medical treatement, or other basic survival items.
              </li>
              <li>
                cutting you off from the external world (by, for example, not
                allowing you to talk with friends)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>None of this is okay.</p>
          <p>
            Remember that this is only a small chapter in your life; that you
            have most of it ahead of you. We'll get past thisâ€”together.
